# WeatherBalloon
The main endeavor of this project is to develop an Arduino based weather analysis balloon. The weather balloon will incorporate sensors to calculate humidity, pressure, temperature and altitude. These sensors will be located on an Arduino Weather Shield, where the Arduino will be the package of the weather balloon. The Arduino will take data readings every 4-5 seconds as the weather balloon ascends. A desktop application is created in order to show this change in data in real-time; on site during the weather balloon launch. This application will allow users to save the data gathered from the Arduino on the computer or tablet used to receive the data from the weather balloon. A website is developed that allows public access to the weather related data gathered during each launch. The site creates graphical representations of the data and provides a convenient environment for users to download these images and store the raw data that was read from the sensors. The website also establishes a secure system that allows an administrator or instructor to upload new data and manage current data stored on the site.
