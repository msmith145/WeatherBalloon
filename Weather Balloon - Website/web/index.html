				<p>Here GSU's Department of Geosciences has provided public access to several lab experiments. 
                                    These experiments are designed for use by GSU's Climate Literacy labs and undergraduate geoscience students. 
                                    You can find these labs here: <a href="http://sites.gsu.edu/geog1112/geography-1112-gsu/">Introduction to Weather and Climate Labs</a></p>
				<p>As of now, we have successfully uploaded functionality for a weather analysis balloon. GSU geoscience students will take part in
                                    launching the weather balloon as part of their hands-on lab assignment. The launch will take place on GSU's campus, during lab time.
                                    The weather analysis device will take several sensor readings as it rises, including pressure, humidity, altitude and temperature.
                                    This site will allow you to view and download the data retrieved from the weather balloon. You can download the data
                                    as an excel CSV file and save each of the following graphs as images: Temperature vs Time, Pressure vs Time, Humidity vs Time and 
                                Altitude vs Time. </p>
                            <p>We anticipate adding an addition hands-on lab assignment to be hosted from this site. This experiment will focus on carbon dioxide readings.
                            The students will walk around GSU's campus, located in the heart of downtown Atlanta, and take various carbon dioxide measurements. This
                            lab is currently underway.</p>
                            <p>Given the technical nature of these lab experiments, we provide public access to all programming and hardware designs with documentation.
                             We hope that other educational facilities might be able to recreate the experiments to use in their own labs.</p>
